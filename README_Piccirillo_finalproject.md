# Piccirillo_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject

## Summary

Repository for ENV872 final project by Laura Piccirillo, focused on selenium concentrations in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean. The seawater samples included in this analysis were collected with Go-FLO trace-metal clean bottles in 2013 on the U.S. GEOTRACES East Pacific Zonal Transect (GP16) cruise from Peru to Tahiti. 

Selenium (Se) is a trace element and exists in various oxidation states throughout the water column (selenate, selenite, elemental Se, selenide). The marine biogeochemical cycling of Se is not well constrained, and these concentration measurements of the various forms of Se are helpful in constraining its cycling.

This project was carried out in December 2025.

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions

Folders for code, data, and output are present. 

Code folder:

Data folder (Raw): CSV files for raw data downloaded from http://lod.bco-dmo.org/id/dataset/647606 and https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/522668. File names remained in original form from download.

Data folder (Processed):

Output folder: 

\<describe the folders contained in the repository, including what type of files they contain\>

<describe the formats of files for the various purposes contained in the repository>

<describe your file naming conventions>

Files are named according to the following naming convention: `databasename_datatype_details_stage.format`, where: 

**databasename** refers to the database from where the data originated

**datatype** is a description of data 

**details** are additional descriptive details, particularly important for processed data 

**stage**refers to the stage in data management pipelines (e.g., raw, cleaned, or processed)

**format** is a non-proprietary file format (e.g., .csv, .txt)

## Metadata

\<For each data file in the repository, describe the data contained in each column. Include the column name, a description of the information, the class of data, and any units associated with the data. Create a list or table for each data file.\>

## Scripts and code

\<list any software scripts/code contained in the repository and a description of their purpose.\>
